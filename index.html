        This is the story of Many Uch, a Cambodian refugee who has been fighting his order of deportation for almost 20 years. It is also the story of how refugees and permanent residents may be deported for mistakes they made in their youth – mistakes they’ve already paid their debts for.

        Today, Uch is a proud husband and father, a dedicated mentor and a nationally recognized advocate. He has a pardon from the Washington governor, runs a nonprofit and has been appointed to a statewide commission on prisoner reentry.

        But in the eyes of US immigration law, he is still a “criminal alien.”

        Uch was born in Cambodia in 1976, in the middle of the genocide (1975-1979) orchestrated by the Khmer Rouge. The radical communist party rose to power in the chaos of the US bombings of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.

        The genocide killed 2 million people through starvation, murder, and torture – an estimated 21% of the Cambodian population.

        In 1979, the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia to expel the Khmer Rouge. Uch, his mother, and his two older brothers were taken by the Khmer Rouge into jungle as prisoners. They were separated from his father who thought they had died, and spent a year foraging in the jungle until they were found and rescued by the Red Cross.

        Uch and his mother and siblings spent time in several camps in Thailand for three years before arriving at a camp in the Philippines. Uch was a bright kid, and started to learn English.

        On April 14, 1984 they were resettled in Richmond, Virginia, where they didn’t know anyone.  They were put into low-income housing and lived on welfare, with no one to help them adjust to life in a new country. A year later they moved to Seattle, to the rough White Center neighborhood where they knew some other Cambodian refugees had been placed.

        Refugees from Southeast Asia are the largest community of refugees ever resettled in the United States. Over 1.3 million refugees were resettled after the war in Vietnam ended in 1975. Cambodian refugees were resettled across the country, but many families moved to join large communities in Seattle, WA, Long Beach, CA, Lowell, MA, and Philadelphia, PA.

        Many’s family lived in poverty, like most other refugees from Cambodia who arrived in the United States penniless and deeply traumatized. Teachers in Seattle didn’t know how to support him. His mother couldn’t speak English and was unable to help him navigate the school system.

        Many was put into an ESL program in an “alternative school” where little was expected of him. He recalled that many of the girls were pregnant and most of the boys were involved in illegal activity. Some of his classmates picked on him for being poor and different, and for getting off the bus in “the projects.” He started to hang out with other kids in the ESL program who would defend each other if they got picked on. He sometimes got into fights.

        Many Southeast Asian boys and young men turned to gangs both for protection and for a support system.
