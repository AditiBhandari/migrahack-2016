	<p>With the help of lawyer Jay Stansell, Many and others participated in a legal challenge to indefinite detention that resulted in a landmark Supreme Court case (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadvydas_v._Davis" target="_blank">Zadvydas v. Davis</a>). During the years that the case wound through the courts, Many and others were slowly released from immigration detention, either by administrative relief or through court order.</p>
	<p>In June 2001, the Court ruled that no one could be held longer than six months without a reasonable chance of being deported in the near future, which meant Many and the others could live their lives in the community until they could be deported.</p>
