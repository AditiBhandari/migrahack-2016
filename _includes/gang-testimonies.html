          <blockquote>
"I came here when I was six. I was born during the war in the Khmer Rouge time. There was no medical treatment, nothing. I grew up in a gang-infested neighborhood in Stockton, but I was a good kid...but then one day a man came to my elementary school and started shooting at Cambodian refugee kids. I saw blood all over, it was like the Killing Fields again.  After that, my grades slipped, I had nightmares. I started getting in trouble."

                  "When I was nine, my family moved to a neighborhood in Seattle where there was a lot of crime, drugs, and gangs. My older brother left when I was young and couldn’t protect me, and I got bullied at school for being Asian and being poor. My mom was still in shock from surviving the war, she couldn’t really help me either. So I had to start fighting back, and I got involved in some bad stuff. When I was 18, I got arrested for robbing a convenience store. No one got hurt, but I served 10 years."

          <p class="gang-testimony__narrative">Leach Chhoeun came to the United States as a refugee from Cambodia when he was four years old, after most of his family was killed during the genocide. Like other refugees, Leach’s family was resettled in an impoverished neighborhood plagued by gang violence and poor schools. Cambodian youth were picked on and began joining together for protection. By elementary school, Leach was in a gang. In 1996, at the age of 18, Leach was arrested and served one year in state prison. After getting out, Leach left gang life, got married, had two daughters, and started taking care of his frail mother. Over the next 20 years, his only brother was killed in a drive-by shooting, and his father and two sisters died of Lupus. When he was finally deported in 2015, his mother was left with no one.</p>
