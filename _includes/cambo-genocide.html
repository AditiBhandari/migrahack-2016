	<p>Uch was born in Cambodia in 1976, in the middle of the genocide (1975-1979) orchestrated by the Khmer Rouge. The radical communist party rose to power in the chaos of the US bombings of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.</p>
	<p>The genocide killed 2 million people through starvation, murder, and torture â€“ an estimated 21% of the Cambodian population.</p>
	<p>In 1979, the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia to expel the Khmer Rouge. Uch, his mother, and his two older brothers were taken by the Khmer Rouge into jungle as prisoners. They were separated from his father who thought they had died, and spent a year foraging in the jungle until they were found and rescued by the Red Cross.</p>
	<p>Uch and his mother and siblings spent time in several camps in Thailand for three years before arriving at a camp in the Philippines. Uch was a bright kid, and started to learn English.</p>
